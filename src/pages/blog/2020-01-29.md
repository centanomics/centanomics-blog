Hello, World!

My name is Shannon, but I'll usually refer to myself as Cent (at least online), so you can do the same. I'm not sure what direction I want to take my blog in, but for now, it's just going to consist of my journey through learning Gatsby and a few other projects I'm working on. The format of the blog will change often too, until I find a format that I like.

Anyway onto me!

I am a chill person, who enjoys spending my free time watching travel vlogs and learning about the geography of my own country, the USA, along with others. I've been learning about code since high school, and have come to appreciate it. When I'm not fixing bugs, I'm either walking, drinking a good cup of tea, or practicing German.

As I'm writing this, I realize I'm not the best at describing myself but as I keep writing, I'll get better. Thanks for reading!

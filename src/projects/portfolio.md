This project is an adoption website for pets that focuses on the shelters themselves. By entering in the zipcode and name of a shelter you can find shelters near you and see what kind of pets each shelter has.

### Tech Stack

For this project I used the MERN stack, more specifically:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

This project I focused on learning gatsby. I implemented what I learned in the tutorual on the website. I also wanted to practice some animations using React Spring which I sprinkled throughout this project!

### Tech Stack

For this project I used Gatsby as my static site generator. This includes React and GraphQL. As mentioned before I also used React Spring which allows me to add animations to my components

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Graph-ql](https://graphql.org/)
- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)

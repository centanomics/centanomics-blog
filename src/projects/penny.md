Contact Keeper is a Full Stack Application that keeps track of any contacts that you add to your account. Users are able to add contacts as they please to a filterable list, where they can search by name or email. They also can edit their contacts in case of a mistake, or just delete their contacts. Users will need to login to use the application with their contacts matching with their account only.

### Tech Stack

For this project I used the MERN stack, more specifically:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- and various npm packages that aided in security, including:
  - [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
  - [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

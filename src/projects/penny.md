Penny is my discord bot that I made using javascript and the discordjs node module. It's something that I will always work on and continually adding functionality to. As of writing this description, the bot can handle basic moderator duties and a few other fun commands like flipping a coin or creating bets with the fellow server members. A point of focus is also creating clubs that you can join and even ping if you need to down the line!

### Tech Stack

For this project I mainly focused on javascript and the appropriate npm packages like discord.js. There is an express server setup, which I do plan on expanding on in the future.

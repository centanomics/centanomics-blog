Contact Keeper is a Full Stack Application that keeps track of any contacts that you add to your account. Users are able to add contacts as they please to a filterable list, where they can search by name or email. They also can edit their contacts in case of a mistake, or just delete their contacts. Users will need to login to use the application with their contacts matching with their account only.

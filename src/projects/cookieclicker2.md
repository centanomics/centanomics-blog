I decided to highlight my portfolio because for this project, I wanted to learn Gatsby. I also wanted to practice some animations using React Spring which I sprinkled throughout this project!

### Tech Stack

For this project I used Gatsby as my static site generator. This includes React and GraphQL.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

This was a project I worked on with two other people for a Hackathon back in December. There was no real theme, just make an application, and we decided to go for a cookie clicker game, but we made it multiplayer. Anyone who had the link to the site could join and start clicking on the screen to earn cookies towards a goal. There are general stats for you to see and there is also a chatroom to talk with other clickers! It was all in all an enjoyable experience creating this application despite not getting a top stop in the Hackathon.

### Tech Stack

For this project I used Gatsby as my static site generator. This includes React and GraphQL.
